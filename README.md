Documentation on how to grant and revoke access to our GBQ Salesforce Views 

# How Users can request access
User that need access to the Salesforce Data we store in BigQuery are supposed to request that access in the [#ask-ces-data](https://springernature.slack.com/archives/C04RME8NK40) channel by stating who needs access and why they need access.

The channel can also be used by users to notify us if there are any issues regarding the data or whether they need different views created for them.


# Granting access to Users
In order to grant access to colleagues, you have to add them to the corresponding Google Group [CES Salesforce BQ](https://groups.google.com/a/springernature.com/g/ces_salesforce_bqviews/members)

To add them, click the "Add members" button on the top and the colleagues that need access in the "Group Members" field and click "Add members" to add them.

By doing that, the colleague gets access to all currently available views in the SF_DataViews dataset.

# Revoking access to Users
Similar to granting access, it is done via the aforementioned Google Group. To remove someones access, do the opposite to granting access and remove them from the Group.

To remove them, select the user on the left and click on "Remove user" on the top.
